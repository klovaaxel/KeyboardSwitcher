Keyboard Switcher is a Windows Form application that simplifies the process of switching between different keyboard layouts when you switch between different keyboards.

## ðŸ“š How to Use

1. Launch the application.
2. Press any key on a keyboard.
3. The application will add a new input line where you can assign a name and a layout to your keyboard.
4. To remove a keyboard, press the remove button.
5. Now, when you type on a keyboard, the application will automatically switch to the assigned layout.
