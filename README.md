# Keyboard Switcher

This is a simple windows form application that allows you to switch between different keyboard layouts automatically when you switch between different keyboards.

## How to use

luanch the application, press any key on a keyboard, the application will add a new input line where you can assing your keyboard a name and a layout. You can also remove a keyboard by pressing the remove button.

Now when you type on that keyboard, the application will automatically switch to the layout you assigned to it.
(but only if the last keyboard you typed on is the _not_ same as the one you are typing on now, this to allow for manual overrides)
